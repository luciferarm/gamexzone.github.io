								<h4 class="major">Cyberpunk 2077</h4>
								<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an upcoming role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. It is scheduled to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Stadia, and Xbox One on 17 September 2020. Adapted from the Cyberpunk franchise, it takes place in dystopian Night City, an open world with six distinct regions. Players assume the role of V, a customisable mercenary, in a first-person perspective, acquiring skills in hacking and machinery, an arsenal of ranged weapons, and options for melee combat. Both lethal and non-lethal playthroughs are possible.
                                Cyberpunk 2077 is developed using the REDengine 4 game engine, with around 500 people, exceeding the number that worked on the studio's previous game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. </p>

								<h4 class="major">Forza Horizon 4</h4>

								<h4 class="major">Fortnite</h4>
								<p>Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018. Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative released for all those platforms, and also for Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android devices.</p>
								

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/game4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4 class="major">Minecraft</h4>
								<p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. Minecraft was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language and was released as a public alpha for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the bestselling video game of all time, with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.
								In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world, and may discover and  extract raw materials, craft tools, build structures or earthworks, and depending on game mode, can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.</p>

								<h4 class="major">Star Citizen players aren't pleased with recent roadmap </h4>
								<h6 class="major">Date : 27 April 2020</h6>

								<p>Game development roadmaps are rarely set in stone, but some recent changes to Star Citizen's has ruffled the feathers of its community of interstellar pilots. 
								A roadmap roundup, posted late last week, highlighted some of the notable changes to the upcoming Alpha 4.0 update, expected in June, including a few items that have been pushed back or removed until a later date. The server to client actor networking rework is one such feature, which has been delayed until 4.1. Players and AI characters are handled by the client, which means when you perform an action, the local client does the action and then sends the information to the server, at which point other players see it happen. It's apparently been a problem when it comes to tackling cheating, and it also means players see a lot of rubber banding from players with poor connections. With the rework, this will be handled server-side</p>

							<h4 class="major">Check out this massive city made by Minecraft professionals</h4>
							<h6 class="major">Date : 27 April 2020</h6>
								<p>Today I learned there are people who get paid to make Minecraft worlds for private clients, entire teams of builders and designers who work to spec. One such team is Varuna, and they're responsible for the city seen here.
                                Though it looks a bit like the Imperial City from Oblivion to me, it's actually the the Labyrinth City of Orario from the anime/manga/light novel series Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? Every building has its own interior, and the central tower-dungeon hits Minecraft's upper limit for verticality.
                                It apparently took over two months' worth of roughly 12-hour days for the Varuna team to make, so whatever the client paid for it I imagine it must have been steep. Of course, being a private creation means we can't download it and have a look for ourselves so we'll have to content ourselves with the screenshots from their website.</p>

								<h4 class="major">Travis Scott's Fortnite show had a record-breaking  players</h4>
								<h6 class="major">Date : 27 April 2020</h6>
								<p>Fortnite hosted a wee music event last night, you might have noticed. Just an intimate show for Travis Scott's new tune, Astronomical, enjoyed by a few fans. 12.3 million of them. 
                                That's the highest concurrent player count that the battle royale has seen, and around 2 million more than Marshmello's EDM performance got last year. At the time, it touted itself as a history-making performance, even though in-game concerts have been around for ages, but it was certainly the most popular. Until Scott's performance. </p>
